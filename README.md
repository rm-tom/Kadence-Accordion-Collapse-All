# Instructions

For UC Berkeley Engineering WP account using the engineering themes. Here is how to implement it. 

1. Copy the contents from togglefunction.js, wrap it around <script> ... </script> tag and paste it inside Scripts->Body Script (It'll be at the botton of the block editor of your wordpress site)
2. Copy the contents from style.css and paste it inside Page Level CSS. 
3. Copy the contents from button.html and past it where where you want the toggle switch to the located in. 

Other users also can use similar procedures. You may find the implemetation of it in https://cml.berkeley.edu/cml-blue-reports/

# Known Issues
Sometimes, after you use this toggle switch, the individual clicks may not work. The issue can be resolved by refreshing the page. I am ignoring it since its rare for it be a significant issue.
