# Kadence Accordion Collapse all function

Important Note: If you find this useful, please send me a note at roshantom [at] berkeley.edu, as this (almost) ruined my day!


# Instructions

Here is how to implement it for the UC Berkeley College of Engineering WP Engine account.

1. Copy the contents from togglefunction.js, wrap it around <script> ... </script> tag, and paste it inside Scripts->Body Script (It'll be at the bottom of the block editor of your WordPress site)
2. Copy the contents from style.css and paste it inside Page Level CSS. 
3. Copy the contents of button.html and paste them where you want the toggle switch to be located. 

Other users also can use similar procedures. You may find the implementation of it at https://cml.berkeley.edu/cml-blue-reports/

# Known Issues
Sometimes, individual clicks may not work after you use this toggle switch. Refreshing the page can resolve the issue, so I am ignoring it for now.
