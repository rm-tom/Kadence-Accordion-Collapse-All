# Kadence Accordion open all or collapse all function

Request: If you find this useful, please send me a note at roshantom [at] berkeley.edu. This small project (almost) ruined my day, so knowing it helped someone would make my day. 

What it does: If your WordPress site uses Kadence Accordion, you can use this script to toggle all the panels close or open.

# Instructions

Here is how to implement it for the UC Berkeley College of Engineering WP Engine account.

1. Copy the contents from togglefunction.js, wrap it around <script> ... </script> tag, and paste it inside Scripts->Body Script (It'll be at the bottom of the block editor of your WordPress site)
2. Copy the contents from style.css and paste it inside Page Level CSS. 
3. Copy the contents of button.html and paste them where you want the toggle switch to be. 

Other users also can use similar procedures. You may find the implementation of it at https://cml.berkeley.edu/cml-blue-reports/

# Known Issues
Sometimes, individual clicks may not work after you use this toggle switch. Refreshing the page can resolve the issue, so I am ignoring it now.
